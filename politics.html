    <h1>When the Elephant Lost its Trunk: A Post-Election Safari in the Republic of Uncommon Sense
</h1>
<img src="IMG/addo.jpg" alt="">
<p>In the jungle of Ghana’s democracy, a strange fever has gripped a once-mighty herd. No, it’s not malaria — it’s something more dangerous: Post-Election Heartbreak mixed with Selective Memory Loss.


The elephant — once majestic, trumpet-blowing and full of swagger — has been wounded by the very citizens it once carried on its back.

Now, angry and confused, it’s lashing out. At tweets. At satire. At Facebook comments. Even at market women asking if "One District, One Factory" included the new factory of tears currently in mass production.

Suddenly, the once noble gentlemen and gentleladies of the elephant family — those who used to quote policy and sip tea — have turned into keyboard ninjas. Swinging wild insults left, right, and centre like a boxer fighting both the referee and the crowd.

One minute, the Ghanaian voter was “discerning.” The next, we’re all “ignorant ingrates” with short memories and empty stomachs.

Well, dear patriots, a quick proverb refresher:

 If you borrow someone’s eyes to insult the blind, be sure to return them before sunset.

 When you build a house and forget to roof it, don’t blame the rain for entering.

The pot you once praised for good soup — don’t suddenly call it foolish because you burnt the stew.
