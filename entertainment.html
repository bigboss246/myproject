         Somewhere between the hush of a prayer whispered at dawn and the riot of music beneath nightclub strobes, Gyakie was writing.
Not just songs but memories, moments, and all the feelings that don’t always fit neatly into lyrics. It was during these still,
 spectral hours after midnight that the Ghanaian Afro-fusion singer found her truest voice. And now, after three years of quiet creation and loud self-discovery,
  that voice resounds across her long-awaited debut album, After Midnight.
This isn’t just another album rollout. It’s a revelation. <br>
A Voice That Found Its Timing
When Gyakie first entered the scene in 2019, she came in soft but sure. No vocal gymnastics, no gimmicks—just smooth storytelling wrapped in a sound as warm as a Ghanaian dusk.
 Her debut EP Seed introduced the world to a voice steeped in highlife heritage, laced with R&B tenderness, and tempered by Afrobeats flair. She followed that with My Diary,
  another EP that stretched her emotional and sonic palette. With each project, she was piecing together her identity as an artist, steadily rising through West Africa’s competitive music ecosystem—and beyond.
But even as the world caught on, Gyakie was playing the long game. The EPs were chapters. What she really wanted was a book. <br>
Writing in the Dark
The title After Midnight isn’t poetic for poetry’s sake. It’s literal. Most of this album was conceived in those quiet hours when the world sleeps but creatives stir. 
Gyakie often found herself in the studio, barefoot and alone, freestyling ideas under dim lights and humming beats that hadn’t yet found their words. For her,
 the silence of night was sacred—filled with memory, introspection, and divine downloads. <br>

“I cherish dawn,” she’s said before, “because it was always a time of prayer in my house.” Her mother would rise before the sun to speak blessings over the family. That energy, that peace, 
is palpable in many of the tracks here. But so is the chaos of nightlife—sweaty shows, flashing lights, and the hum of a thousand conversations in the dark.
This is the duality After Midnight lives in: sacred and scandalous, reflective and reckle

<h1>Lyrics and life of Daddy Lumba, a perspective
</h1>
<img src="IMG/lumba.png" alt="">
<p>Exciting yet an enigmatic personality, Charles Kwadwo Fosu, affectionately called Daddy Lumba, certainly cannot be ignored, even for many years to come.
Though dead, his songs echo through the Ghanaian space, establishing him as one of Ghana’s most loved and even controversial sons.
This great lyricist made his personal life struggles, love themes and realities of life part of the Ghanaian thought and psyche.
Every song he wrote or co-authored and sang pointed to a milestone on his epic musical and life journey.
Thrusting himself onto the Ghanaian music scene with the classic, “Yee Ye Aka Akwantuomu”, which surely resonates with the Ghanaian diaspora, where many undocumented people are in a lockdown.
They are in a limbo. Having invested all they have to relocate abroad for a better life, their goals have to be put on hold because they lack the documents to seek the economic paradise they see around them.
It is a torture that many cannot bear, and those who endure it bear the scars of humiliation, delayed destiny and a past which cannot be recalled without pain and sorrow.
For many, returning home empty-handed is not even an option because the Ghanaian society is not kind to a poor returnee
One of his songs, “Odofo pa ama ntem”, tells the pain a man faces during his love journey. Having waded through a turbulent sea of heartbreaks and self-inflicted pain,
 he succumbs to a different kind of love that uplifts him into a blissful union, but it happens too late. What a tapestry woven by this master lyricist.</p>
